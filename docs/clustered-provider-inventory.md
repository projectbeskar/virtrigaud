# Clustered-provider inventory: `Host` and `HostPool`

> **Status:** ADR-0007 P1, first slice. **Additive and v1beta1-safe.** Single-host

VirtRigaud is adding a new *class* of provider — a **clustered / orchestrator**
provider — that makes VirtRigaud itself the cluster manager for hypervisors that
lack a native one (libvirt/KVM first). Instead of one gRPC process bound to one
host, a clustered provider fronts N bare hosts, and VirtRigaud owns the host
inventory, placement, and (later) cross-host migration.

The design follows the industry-proven **brain/hands split** (oVirt Engine/VDSM,
OpenStack nova-scheduler/nova-compute): all durable state and all decisions live
in the operator and CRDs; the provider stays a stateless executor (ADR-0007 D1).
The two CRDs below are the durable inventory that the brain reasons over.

See [ADR-0007](adr/0007-clustered-orchestrator-provider.md) for the full design,
rationale, and phasing.

## `HostPool` — a named group of hosts under one clustered provider

`HostPool` (shortName `hp`) carries **cluster policy** for a group of hosts:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `spec.providerRef` | The clustered `Provider` that owns this pool. |
| `spec.strategy` | Default scheduling strategy: `Spread` (default) or `BinPack`. |
| `spec.overcommit` | CPU/memory overcommit ratios (decimal strings, e.g. `"4.0"`). |
| `spec.storagePools[]` | Named shared/local storage pools available in the pool. |
| `spec.networks[]` | Named networks (bridge/VLAN/overlay) available in the pool. |
| `spec.migration` | Default migration policy: `defaultLive` (default `true`), `defaultStorageMode` (`shared`\|`block_all`\|`block_inc`\|`stage_copy`, default `shared`), `requireTLS` (default `false`), and optional `bandwidthMbps` / `maxDowntimeMs` caps. |

`status` aggregates member-host counts and readiness (`totalHosts`, `readyHosts`,
`schedulableHosts`).

VirtRigaud **consumes** pre-set-up storage and networking; it does not deploy
them (ADR-0007 D6).

## `Host` — one bare hypervisor host

`Host` (shortName `hvh`) is **admin-authored desired inventory** in `spec`, and
**operator-synced observed state** in `status` — the clean desired/observed split:
the admin declares *what hosts exist*; the provider reports *what they can do
right now*.

| `spec` field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `providerRef` | The clustered `Provider` that executes on this host. |
| `poolRef` | The `HostPool` this host joins (membership is declared by the host, ADR-0007 D3). |
| `endpoint` | Connection URI (libvirt: `qemu+ssh://user@host/system`). |
| `credentialSecretRef` | Optional per-host credential override; defaults to the Provider's. |
| `labels` | Placement facts consumed as **hard scheduling constraints** (ADR-0007 D6): storage-pool visibility, network/bridge visibility, zone/rack. |
| `schedulable` | Defaults `true`; set `false` to cordon (no new placement, existing VMs stay). |

`status` (populated later by the inventory-sync controller) reports `health`
(`Ready`\|`NotReady`\|`Unknown`), allocatable CPU/memory/storage, CPU
model/features, machine types, emulator version, bound-VM count, and last
heartbeat. It carries capacity and health only — **never connection secrets**
(ADR-0007 Security).

### Placement labels are load-bearing

The nastiest silent failure in clustering is migrating a VM to a host whose
bridge name matches but whose VLAN is wrong — the NIC attaches and traffic
blackholes. VirtRigaud models this as a scheduling constraint from day one:
a VM is only placed or migrated onto a host that can **see its storage pool** and
**has its network**, asserted via `Host.spec.labels` matching the pool's
`storagePools` / `networks`. Reserving that constraint surface early is cheap;
retrofitting it after VMs are stranded is not.

## Example

See [`examples/hostpool-clustered.yaml`](../examples/hostpool-clustered.yaml):
one `HostPool` (Spread strategy) with two `Host`s that both see storage pool
`nfs01` and bridge `br-vlan100`, making shared-storage live migration between
them possible once the migration slice ships.

## What "clustered" does not mean (yet)

- **No automatic HA / failover.** v1 detects and surfaces host-down and supports
  operator-initiated evacuation, but does **not** auto-restart VMs elsewhere.
  Without fencing/STONITH that would risk split-brain disk corruption; automatic
  HA is a deferred future ADR (ADR-0007 D8/P5).
- **No scheduler or migration in this slice.** This PR ships the `Host` and
  `HostPool` CRDs only. The inventory-sync controller, the filter+score scheduler,
  `target_host_id` on create, and live migration land in later ADR-0007 slices.
