# GitHub Actions Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed all GitHub Actions workflows to modernize them, add security hardening, include Proxmox provider support, and ensure multi-arch builds work correctly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Before:** Missing Proxmox provider, old action versions, single-arch builds
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `provider-proxmox` to build matrix
- ✅ Updated all actions to latest versions (`@v5`, `@v6`, `@v4`)
- ✅ Added QEMU setup for multi-arch builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- ✅ Added concurrency groups and timeout controls
- ✅ Updated runner to `ubuntu-24.04`
- ✅ Added proper Go cache with `go-version-file: go.mod`
- ✅ Added golangci-lint action for better linting
- ✅ Added shell safety with `bash -euxo pipefail`
- ✅ Added CI summary job to check all dependencies

### 2. **Conversion Tests** (`.github/workflows/conversion.yml`)
**Before:** Old action versions, missing timeouts
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added concurrency controls
- ✅ Added proper permissions (`contents: read`)
- ✅ Updated runner to `ubuntu-24.04` with timeouts
- ✅ Updated Go setup to use `go.mod` and cache

### 3. **Helm CRD Installation** (`.github/workflows/helm-crds.yml`)
**Before:** Old action versions, missing timeouts  
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added concurrency controls and permissions
- ✅ Updated runner and timeouts
- ✅ Modernized Go setup with caching
- ✅ Kept existing CRD validation logic (was already correct)

### 4. **Provider SDK** (`.github/workflows/provider-sdk.yml`)
**Before:** Missing Proxmox paths, old actions
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added Proxmox provider paths to trigger conditions
- ✅ Updated all runners to `ubuntu-24.04` with timeouts
- ✅ Modernized all Go setup actions
- ✅ Added concurrency controls
- ✅ Note: Kept scaffold matrix as `generic` type (Proxmox uses generic scaffolding)

### 5. **Runtime Chart** (`.github/workflows/runtime-chart.yml`)
**Before:** Missing Proxmox template test
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added Proxmox values template test
- ✅ Updated runners and timeouts
- ✅ Modernized Go setup
- ✅ Added concurrency controls
- ✅ **Created missing file:** `charts/virtrigaud-provider-runtime/examples/values-proxmox.yaml`

### 6. **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
**Before:** Missing Proxmox in builds, old action versions
**After:** ✅ Fixed

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `provider-proxmox` to all build matrices
- ✅ Added QEMU setup for ARM64 builds
- ✅ Updated Docker build action to `@v6`
- ✅ Added Proxmox to release notes template
- ✅ Updated Go setup with modern caching
- ✅ Added concurrency control (no cancel for releases)

### 7. **New Files Created**
- ✅ `charts/virtrigaud-provider-runtime/examples/values-proxmox.yaml` - Comprehensive Proxmox provider values
- ✅ `actions_failures.md` - Evidence of issues found
- ✅ `actions_fixes_summary.md` - This summary

### 8. **Makefile Improvements**
- ✅ Added `make ci` target that runs all CI checks locally
- ✅ Combines: `test lint proto-lint generate manifests vet`

## Common Improvements Across All Workflows

### Security Hardening
- ✅ Added `timeout-minutes` to prevent hanging jobs (10-30 min)
- ✅ Added concurrency groups to prevent overlapping runs
- ✅ Restricted permissions to minimum required
- ✅ Added `shell: bash -euxo pipefail` for safer scripts

### Action Modernization
- ✅ `actions/setup-go@v4` → `@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod` and `cache: true`
- ✅ `actions/cache@v3` → removed (Go action handles caching)
- ✅ `docker/build-push-action@v5` → `@v6`
- ✅ Added `docker/setup-qemu-action@v3` for multi-arch builds

### Multi-Architecture Support
- ✅ Added QEMU setup for ARM64 builds
- ✅ Updated platform strings to `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- ✅ Verified all Dockerfiles support multi-arch

### Provider Integration
- ✅ Added Proxmox to all build matrices where needed
- ✅ Added Proxmox paths to workflow triggers
- ✅ Created missing Proxmox example values
- ✅ Updated documentation templates

## Validation Results

### Files Fixed
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Comprehensive modernization
- ✅ `.github/workflows/conversion.yml` - Security and modernization
- ✅ `.github/workflows/helm-crds.yml` - Timeout and action updates
- ✅ `.github/workflows/provider-sdk.yml` - Proxmox integration
- ✅ `.github/workflows/runtime-chart.yml` - Proxmox template testing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Multi-arch and Proxmox support
- ✅ `Makefile` - Added CI target
- ✅ `charts/virtrigaud-provider-runtime/examples/values-proxmox.yaml` - New

### Expected Outcomes
When these workflows run:

1. **CI**: Will build all 4 providers (manager, libvirt, vsphere, proxmox) for multi-arch
2. **Helm**: Will validate Proxmox template rendering 
3. **Release**: Will produce ARM64 + AMD64 images for all providers
4. **Security**: Will have proper timeouts and permissions
5. **Local**: Developers can run `make ci` to replicate CI checks

## Remaining Tasks (If Needed)

### Optional Enhancements (not blocking)
- [ ] Add chart testing (ct) for Helm validation
- [ ] Add status badges to README.md  
- [ ] Gate integration tests on secret availability
- [ ] Add performance testing integration

### Files Not Modified (Already Working)
- `actions_failures.md` - Evidence collection
- `.github/workflows/catalog.yml` - Provider catalog (working)
- `.github/workflows/compat-old-provider.yml` - Compatibility tests (working)
- `.github/workflows/proxmox-conformance.yml` - New Proxmox-specific tests (already modern)

## Ready for Testing

All workflows are now ready to test. The key improvements:

1. **Multi-arch builds** will now work for ARM64 + AMD64
2. **Proxmox provider** is integrated throughout
3. **Security** is hardened with timeouts and permissions
4. **Performance** is improved with proper caching
5. **Local development** is improved with `make ci`

To test: Create a PR or push to main branch, and verify all workflows pass with these modernizations.
